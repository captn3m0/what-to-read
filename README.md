# what-to-read

This is a tiny side-project I did on [World Book Day 2015].

It was written to help me decide what book to buy next. I usually do that by
looking at my GoodReads To-Read list and comparing it against amazon. This tool
automates that.

It also allows you to post a link to a list of books (such as a discussion on 
Hacker News). It will find all amazon links in that post and compare the listed
books for you.

You can see a sample result [here][demo].
